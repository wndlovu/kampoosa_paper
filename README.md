## Kampoosa Bog Data

<img src="results/location.png" width="700px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Kampoosa Bog is a 70ha wetland complex located in Stockbridge-Lee MA
that is currently being impacted by road salt pollution. In a effort to
understand the impacts of road salt on the water quality and vegetation
in the wetland, the Mass DOT and Department of Fish and Wildlife have
collaborated with engineers (Erich Hinlein and Camelia Rotaru) at the
University of Massachusetts to monitor the water quality at gauge
stations (KB100, KB150, KB300) within the Kampoosa watershed. At these
gauge stations water flow, water temperature and specific conductance
are recorded at a 15 minute interval as of Nov 2017. Data files for this
analysis can be found in the **data** folder.

Files included are:

- `KAMPOOSA BOG for Amy Rhodes`: documentation of the methods used by
  UMass engineers to collect field data

- `UMASS HOBO data`: data downloaded from the gauge stations by the
  UMass engineers

- `UMass Well data`: monthly groundwater ion chemistry data measured
  from grab samples collected at the wells in the fen and the gauge
  sites.

- `Wayne Ndlovu's Analysis`: wrangled data from the probes which
  includes the following sub-folders:

  - `Air_Temperature`: combined air temperature for the 2017-2020 study
    period
  - `Cumulative_HOBO`: contains chloride mass data as recorded at the
    gauge stations
  - `Daily_Summaries`: daily sums and averages for chloride accumulation
    and storage, and weather etc  
  - `Monthly_Summaries`: monthly sums and averages for chloride
    accumulation and storage, and weather etc
  - `Precipitation`: daily precipitation data files for each year and
    one with the combined data  
  - `RoadSalt_Applicatio_I90`: road salt application data provided by
    the MassDOT and calculations for the amount of salt applied to the
    1.2 mile stretch of the Turnpike impacting the Kampoosa watershed  
  - `Water_Temperature`: water temperature at the three gauge stations
