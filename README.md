Kampoosa Bog is a 70ha wetland complex located in Stockbridge-Lee MA
that is currently being impacted by road salt pollution. In a effort to
understand the impacts of road salt on the water quality and vegetation
in the wetland, the Mass DOT and Department of Fish and Wildlife have
collaborated with engineers (Erich Hinlein and Camelia Rotaru) at the
University of Massachusetts to monitor the water quality at gauge
stations (KB100, KB150, KB300) within the Kampoosa watershed. At these
gauge stations water flow, water temperature and specific conductance
are recorded at a 15 minute interval as of Nov 2017.
