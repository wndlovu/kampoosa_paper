Kampoosa Bog is a 70ha wetland complex located in Stockbridge-Lee MA that is currently being impacted by road salt pollution. In a effort to understand the impacts of road salt on the water quality and vegetation in the wetland, the Mass DOT and Department of Fish and Wildlife have collaborated with engineers (Erich Hinlein and Camelia Rotaru) at the University of Massachusetts to monitor the water quality at gauge stations (KB100, KB150, KB300) within the Kampoosa watershed. At these gauge stations water flow, water temperature and specific conductance are recorded at a 15 minute interval as of Nov 2017.
